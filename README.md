# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis-Project-1

## About the project

The objective of this project is to classify hate speech in tweets. In this project, we consider hate speech to be racist or sexist tweets and the sentiment associated with them. 


I will be using a dataset of 31,962 tweets to train my model. The dataset is in a csv format with each line storing a tweeet id, its label and the tweet.

Label '1' denotes that a tweet is racist/sexist. Label '0' denotes that the tweet is not racist/sexist.

The objective is to predict labels on the test dataset.
